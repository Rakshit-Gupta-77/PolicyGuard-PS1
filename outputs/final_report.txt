*Scope:* All levels within the organization are subject to this policy which applies rigorously from executive level decisions down through every employee's end-point device and network access point, including third-party service providers that interact with our systems on a regular basis.


**Roles and Responsibilities:** 
The IT team is tasked to perform the initial patching of organizational hardware monthly or more frequently as required by criticality levels identified through risk assessments, ensuring minimal impact disruption during maintenance windows agreed upon in consultation with business stakeholders.


*Access Control:*
- Roles and permissions for accessing update mechanisms are strictly limited to authorized IT personnel after undergoing rigorous security training aligned with NIST standards on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems (A).
